This is an extension to the Google Chrome browser that simulates how users with disabilities can experience a webpage. The application tries to simulate how a user will experience the web page or create a simular experience.

The goal of this project is to raise awareness of the disabilities that exist and what problems users with a disability may encounter when using a web page.
